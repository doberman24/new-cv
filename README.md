# My new portfolio

My latest portfolio, written in React using Tailwind. The code is divided into blocks and placed in different files. The application is adaptive. There is only a frontend here. The backend is only needed to send mail from the contact page. 

**The fully functional application can be seen at the link http://cv.lixit.ru.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
